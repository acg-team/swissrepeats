# how is the file swissprot_annotations.tsv created?

Downloaded Swissprot annotations on Dec14 from:
http://www.uniprot.org/uniprot/?query=reviewed%3Ayes&sort=score&columns=id%2Cprotein%20names%2Clength%2Clineage(SUPERKINGDOM)%2Clineage(KINGDOM)%2Clineage(ORDER)%2Clineage(CLASS)%2Clineage(FAMILY)%2Clineage(SPECIES)%2Clineage-id(SPECIES)%2Cdatabase(DisProt)%2Cdatabase(MobiDB)%2Cvirus%20hosts%2Cdatabase(OrthoDB)%2Cdatabase(OMA)

The result file was renamed to swissprot_annotations.tsv



# TODO: where is this file stored/generated? ```virus_host_pairs_host_taxname_in_sp.csv```
-> in swissrepeat/src/connect_viruses_virus_hosts.py
this requires two input files: 'swissprot_annotations.tsv' and 'swissrepeat/results/tr_annotations/concatenated.csv'. the later is non existend, the .py script just loads it in the environment but doesn't use it... ???

-> swissrepeat.Rmd works. If strange occurences, check above!!!
